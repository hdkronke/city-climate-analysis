# Climate Data Analysis
## Python Api Challenge

For this project, I used real time climate API data to find a correlation between a city's global coordinates and the weather.

Creating visualizations helped me understand the massive amount of data as it was processed.

I also used linear regression to better understand the relationships and trends in the data.

For the grand finale, API data was used to identify my ideal weather conditions and find specific locations around the globe. I was even able to find any nearby hotels to make vacation planning that much easier!
